        <h1 id="Iowa-Gambling-dens-Battle-in-Court-Over-Ownership-of-Prairie-Meadows-Casino"><a href="#Iowa-Gambling-dens-Battle-in-Court-Over-Ownership-of-Prairie-Meadows-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Gambling dens Battle in Court Over Ownership of Prairie Meadows Casino"></a>Iowa Gambling dens Battle in Court Over Ownership of Prairie Meadows Casino</h1><p>The Iowa Gambling dens Association (IGA) is suing the state of Iowa over who owns the Prairie Meadows Casino. The IGA claims that the casino was illegally taken from them and given to the state.</p>
<p>The Prairie Meadows Casino has been a major source of revenue for the state of Iowa, and the dispute over ownership could have a major impact on the budget.</p>
<p>The IGA was formed in 1988, and one of its first major projects was the development of the Prairie Meadows Casino. The casino was a huge success, and it soon became one of the top earners for the state.</p>
<p>In 1995, then-Governor Terry Branstad decided to take control of the casino and give it to the state. The IGA argues that this was illegal, and that they should be given back control of the casino.</p>
<p>So far, the state has refused to give back control of the casino to the IGA. Governor Kim Reynolds released a statement saying, “The State has no intention of returning management of Prairie Meadows to an entity controlled by out-of-state interests.”</p>
<p>The battle over ownership of Prairie Meadows Casino is likely to continue in court. The stakes are high for both sides, as the casino is a major source of revenue for Iowa.</p>

<p>A district court judge has ordered a trial to begin on November 5 in the case between casino owner Richard M. Hogg and casino manager John Medinger.</p>
<p>Hogg has accused Medinger of mismanaging the casino and violating their management agreement. He is seeking to have Medinger removed as manager and take control of the casino himself.</p>
<p>Medinger has denied the allegations and claimed that Hogg is trying to take control of the casino for his own personal gain.</p>
<p>The trial is expected to last two weeks.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Owns-Prairie-Meadows-Casino"><a href="#Who-Owns-Prairie-Meadows-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Prairie Meadows Casino?"></a>Who Owns Prairie Meadows Casino?</h1><p>The Prairie Meadows Casino, Racetrack and Hotel is a casino located in Altoona, Iowa, United States. The casino is owned by the Pointer Brothers, a group of six siblings who also own casinos in Black Hawk, Colorado and Cripple Creek, Colorado.</p>
<p>The casino opened on July 1, 1989. It features a hotel with 302 rooms, a 24-hour casino with 1,770 slots and 48 table games, three restaurants, and a race track. In fiscal year 2017, the casino’s revenue was $217 million.</p>
<p>The Pointer Brothers are one of the wealthiest families in the United States. In 2013, they were ranked as the eighth-wealthiest family in America by Forbes with an estimated net worth of $5.4 billion.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Tribes-Sue-to-Stop-Sale-of-Prairie-Meadows-Casino-to-Nevada-Group"><a href="#Iowa-Tribes-Sue-to-Stop-Sale-of-Prairie-Meadows-Casino-to-Nevada-Group" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Tribes Sue to Stop Sale of Prairie Meadows Casino to Nevada Group"></a>Iowa Tribes Sue to Stop Sale of Prairie Meadows Casino to Nevada Group</h1><p>The Meskwaki and Sioux tribes of Iowa have filed a lawsuit against the state of Iowa in an attempt to stop the sale of the Prairie Meadows casino to a Nevada group.</p>
<p>The tribes allege that the sale violates their religious freedom, as they consider the casino to be sacred ground. They are also claiming that they were not given a fair chance to buy the casino themselves.</p>
<p>The Nevada group, which is led by Steve Wynn, has already agreed to purchase the casino for $430 million. The sale is expected to be finalized in September.</p>
<p>Iowa officials have said that they believe the sale is legal and that they will fight the lawsuit.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Group-Plans-to-Buy-Out-Prairie-Meadows-Casino"><a href="#Nevada-Group-Plans-to-Buy-Out-Prairie-Meadows-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Group Plans to Buy Out Prairie Meadows Casino"></a>Nevada Group Plans to Buy Out Prairie Meadows Casino</h1><p>The company, which is identified as Nevada Group, has plans to buy out the casino, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The Prairie Meadows Casino and Racetrack is a racino located inAltoona, Iowa. The casino has been in operation since 1989 and features a race track, 2,500 slot machines, and a variety of table games.</p>
<p>The Nevada Group is proposing to pay $1.575 billion for the casino. The offer was made last week and still requires regulatory approval.</p>
<p>According to the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the group has not yet revealed any specific plans for the property should it be successful in acquiring it. It’s possible that the group could reopen it as a casino or redevelop it into something else entirely.</p>
<p>Prairie Meadows Casino is one of the largest properties of its kind in Iowa and employs more than 1,000 people. It’s unclear what would happen to those jobs if the sale goes through.</p>
