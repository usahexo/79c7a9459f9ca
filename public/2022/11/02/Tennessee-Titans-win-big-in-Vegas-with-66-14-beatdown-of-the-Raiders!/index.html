        <h1 id="Tennessee-Titans-win-big-in-Vegas-with-66-14-beatdown-of-the-Raiders"><a href="#Tennessee-Titans-win-big-in-Vegas-with-66-14-beatdown-of-the-Raiders" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee Titans win big in Vegas with 66-14 beatdown of the Raiders!"></a>Tennessee Titans win big in Vegas with 66-14 beatdown of the Raiders!</h1><p>The NFL kicked off its 101st season in dramatic fashion Sunday night, as the Tennessee Titans dismantled the Oakland Raiders 66-14 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>In what may have been a preview of things to come, Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota threw for four touchdowns and ran for another before being pulled from the game in the third quarter. Fellow Heisman Trophy winner and first overall draft pick Baker Mayfield looked sharp in relief, throwing for two more touchdowns.</p>
<p>For the Raiders, it was a night to forget. Quarterback Derek Carr was sacked six times and fumbled three times, leading to 10 Titans points. The defense was no better, allowing Tennessee to rack up 559 yards of total offense.</p>
<p>The lopsided victory gives the Titans some early momentum as they head into their Week 2 matchup against the Cleveland Browns. The Raiders, on the other hand, will need to regroup quickly if they hope to compete in a tough AFC West division.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-take-down-the-Raiders-for-their-4th-consecutive-victory"><a href="#Titans-take-down-the-Raiders-for-their-4th-consecutive-victory" class="headerlink" title="Titans take down the Raiders for their 4th consecutive victory!"></a>Titans take down the Raiders for their 4th consecutive victory!</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans took down the Oakland Raiders by a final score of 26-16. This marks their 4th consecutive victory, and they are now sitting at 5-4 on the season.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota had himself a day, completing 23 of 32 passes for 237 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also rushed for 33 yards on 7 carries. The Titans’ rushing attack was led by Derrick Henry, who ran for 85 yards on 18 carries.</p>
<p> Wide receiver Corey Davis was once again the star of the show for the Titans, catching 8 passes for 118 yards and a touchdown. Tight end Jonnu Smith also hauled in a touchdown catch from Mariota.</p>
<p>For the Raiders, quarterback Derek Carr completed 31 of his 48 pass attempts for 313 yards and a touchdown. He also lost a fumble that was returned for a touchdown by linebacker Jayon Brown. Wide receiver Amari Cooper caught 10 passes for 116 yards in the loss.</p>
<p>This was a big win for the Titans, who are now in control of their own destiny as far as making the playoffs is concerned. They will next travel to Indianapolis to take on the Colts in Week 11.</p>
<h1 id="Tennessee’s-dominant-performance-extends-to-Las-Vegas-routing-Oakland-66-14"><a href="#Tennessee’s-dominant-performance-extends-to-Las-Vegas-routing-Oakland-66-14" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee’s dominant performance extends to Las Vegas, routing Oakland 66-14!"></a>Tennessee’s dominant performance extends to Las Vegas, routing Oakland 66-14!</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans proved on Sunday that their dominant performance in Week 1 was no fluke, routing the Oakland Raiders by a score of 66-14.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota had an outstanding game, completing 19 of 26 passes for four touchdowns and zero interceptions. He also rushed for another touchdown.</p>
<p>The Titans’ receivers were also impressive, with Corey Davis, Taywan Taylor, and Jonnu Smith all catching touchdown passes.</p>
<p>Oakland’s offense was ineffective all day, with quarterback Derek Carr completing only 22 of his 38 pass attempts for just 169 yards and two interceptions.</p>
<p>The Titans now have a 2-0 record and look like one of the top contenders in the AFC. They will next face the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 23.</p>
<h1 id="Tennessee-cruises-past-the-Raiders-in-Sin-City-winning-66-14"><a href="#Tennessee-cruises-past-the-Raiders-in-Sin-City-winning-66-14" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee cruises past the Raiders in Sin City, winning 66-14!"></a>Tennessee cruises past the Raiders in Sin City, winning 66-14!</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans (1-1) went into Las Vegas and absolutely demolished the Raiders (0-2), winning 66-14. Quarterback Marcus Mariota had an incredible game, completing 19 of 23 passes for 256 yards and four touchdowns. The Titans’ defense was also dominant, holding the Raiders to just 214 total yards and forcing two turnovers. This was a great win for Tennessee after they lost their season opener last week.</p>
<p>The Raiders got off to a good start, scoring the game’s first touchdown on a one-yard run by running back DeAndre Washington. However, the Titans responded with 21 unanswered points to take a 21-7 lead at halftime. Mariota threw touchdown passes to wide receivers Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor in the first half, and running back Derrick Henry scored on a seven-yard run.</p>
<p>The Titans continued their dominance in the second half, outscoring the Raiders 45-7. Davis caught two more touchdown passes from Mariota, and tight end Jonnu Smith caught one. The Raiders only managed to score one more touchdown in the second half, on a six-yard run by Washington.</p>
<p>This was an impressive win for the Titans and should give them some confidence heading into their Week 3 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-1). The Raiders are now 0-3 and will need to make some major improvements if they want to compete in the tough AFC West division.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-thrash-Raiders-by-52-points-in-66-casino-via-co-showdown"><a href="#Titans-thrash-Raiders-by-52-points-in-66-casino-via-co-showdown" class="headerlink" title="Titans thrash Raiders by 52 points in 66 casino via co showdown"></a>Titans thrash Raiders by 52 points in 66 casino via co showdown</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans walloped the Oakland Raiders by 52 points in a Week 3 contest at Nissan Stadium. Marcus Mariota tossed four touchdowns on just 18 completions while Derrick Henry added another two scores on the ground in route to a 66-18 victory.</p>
<p>For the Raiders, it was another debacle as Jon Gruden’s return to coaching continues to sour. Derek Carr completed just 15 of his 29 pass attempts for 171 yards and one touchdown, with three interceptions. Amari Cooper was held without a catch after catching 10 balls for 116 yards in Week 2.</p>

<p>In front of a raucous home crowd that repeatedly chanted “Mariota! Mariota!” early and often, the Titans quarterback had a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in the first half. He found Corey Davis twice for touchdowns – including one just before halftime – and also hit tight end Luke Stocker and running back Dion Lewis to build a 34-0 halftime lead.</p>
<p>Henry took over from there, running through gaping holes all afternoon as the Titans racked up 343 rushing yards as a team. The 2016 Heisman Trophy runner-up now has six touchdowns in three games this season.</p>
<p>The rout was never in doubt as Tennessee improved to 2-1 while Oakland fell to 1-2. The 52-point margin of victory is tied for the fifth largest in franchise history, and it’s the largest since hammering Houston 57-7 in 1991.</p>
