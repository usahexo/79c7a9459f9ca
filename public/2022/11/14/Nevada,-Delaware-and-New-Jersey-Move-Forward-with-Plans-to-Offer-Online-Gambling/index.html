        <h1 id="Nevada-Delaware-and-New-Jersey-Move-Forward-with-Plans-to-Offer-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Delaware-and-New-Jersey-Move-Forward-with-Plans-to-Offer-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey Move Forward with Plans to Offer Online Gambling"></a>Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey Move Forward with Plans to Offer Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, September 9th, the governors of Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey announced moves to offer online gambling in their states.</p>
<p>All three states currently have casinos, and Nevada was the first to legalize online poker in February 2013. However, there has been no move to offer other forms of gambling such as casino games or sports betting.</p>
<p>Delaware was the next state to legalize online poker in June 2013, and New Jersey followed in November 2013. In all three cases, approval was given for residents within the state borders to gamble online.</p>
<p>The announcements made this week signal a shift towards cross-border transactions, which would allow players from different states to interact with each other on gambling websites. This would be a major step forward in the legalization of online gambling, as it would remove some of the regulatory hurdles that have been preventing interstate transactions from taking place.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval of Nevada commented on the move: “This agreement is a significant step forward and underscores the cooperation among our three states on issues related to internet gaming… I am pleased that we will be able to offer wagering products to those within our respective states.”</p>
<p>Governor Markell of Delaware added: “This memorandum reflects our shared commitment to advancing iGaming as an important new entertainment option for our residents while protecting consumers and ensuring responsible play.”</p>
<p>Governor Christie of New Jersey said: “This historic agreement marks another major milestone in our effort to effectively regulate Internet gaming at the state level and provide much-needed new revenue for Atlantic City’s struggling casino industry.”</p>
<h1 id="California-Poised-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Poised-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Poised to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>California Poised to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On June 1, 2016, the California Assembly approved a bill to legalize online gambling in the state. The measure now awaits approval by Governor Jerry Brown.</p>
<p>AB 2863, also known as the Internet Poker Consumer Protection Act of 2016, would allow licensed casinos and card clubs in California to offer online poker, as well as other types of online gambling such as blackjack, roulette, and slots. Players would be able to place bets from their computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>The bill is sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray of Merced, who believes it will create jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. “This is an opportunity for California to lead the nation in regulating a new and innovative industry,” said Gray.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for players. They also point out that it is difficult to enforce age restrictions on players, and that it can be used by criminals to launder money.</p>
<p>If approved by Governor Brown, AB 2863 would go into effect on January 1, 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Moves-to-Authorize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Moves-to-Authorize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Moves to Authorize Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Moves to Authorize Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania state government took a major step towards authorizing online gambling within the state. Lawmakers in the Senate approved a measure that would regulate and tax internet gaming, becoming the fourth U.S. state to do so after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would allow both casinos and horse racing tracks to offer gambling services over the internet, with a proposed 14% tax on online gaming revenue. The bill now heads to the House for further consideration.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf voiced his support for the measure, stating that it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state budget. “This is another tool to help us close the deficit without having to raise taxes on people,” he said.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin, but supporters contend that it is a safe and secure way to enjoy casino games from the comfort of home. In any case, it is clear that online gambling is here to stay and is likely only going to become more popular in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Considers-Legalizing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Michigan-Considers-Legalizing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Considers Legalizing Online Gambling"></a>Michigan Considers Legalizing Online Gambling</h1><p>Michigan is one of the latest states to consider legalizing online gambling within its borders. The new bill, which was drafted by State Representative Brandt Iden, would allow people over 21 years of age to gamble online.</p>
<p>If the bill is passed, Michigan will join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of online gambling. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware all allow some form of online gambling, while Pennsylvania is in the process of legalizing it.</p>
<p>Industry experts believe that Michigan could rake in millions in tax revenue if the bill is passed. Gambling experts estimate that the online gambling industry could be worth as much as $1 billion per year, with Michigan taking in a cut of the profits.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and problems. They also argue that it could be difficult to enforce and that there are not enough safeguards in place to protect players from scams and fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Iden, however, believes that the bill will be good for Michigan’s economy. “This is about job creation and economic development,” he said. “It’s an opportunity to bring an industry to Michigan that already exists elsewhere.”</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Mulls-Over-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Illinois-Mulls-Over-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Mulls Over the Pros and Cons of Online Gambling"></a>Illinois Mulls Over the Pros and Cons of Online Gambling</h1><p>Illinois has been considering the legalization of online gambling for a few years now, but no action has been taken as of yet. There are several pros and cons to legalizing this type of gambling, and it is unclear which side will ultimately win out.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of legalizing online gambling include increased tax revenue for the state, more jobs for residents, and an expanded customer base for casinos. Additionally, online gambling would be available to anyone over the age of 21 who is located in Illinois, which could help to boost tourism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some potential drawbacks to legalizing online gambling. One concern is that it could lead to increased levels of addiction and problem gambling. Additionally, there is a risk that minors could gain access to gambling websites, which could potentially have negative consequences for their development.</p>
<p>Overall, there are positives and negatives on both sides of the debate when it comes to legalized online gambling in Illinois. The state will need to weigh these pros and cons carefully before making any decisions about this issue.</p>
