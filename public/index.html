        <h1 id="When-would-you-use-the-Database-Gateway"><a href="#When-would-you-use-the-Database-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="When would you use the Database Gateway?"></a>When would you use the Database Gateway?</h1><p>The Database Gateway is a library that allows your application to connect to various databases without having to know the underlying protocols or networking details. This makes it a very versatile tool that can be used in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>One of the most common uses for the Database Gateway is when you need to connect to a database that is not supported by your development environment. For example, if you are using PHP and want to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database, you can use the Database Gateway to do this for you.</p>
<p>Another situation where the Database Gateway comes in handy is when you want to migrate your data from one database format to another. For example, if you have an existing MySQL database and want to migrate it to Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the Database Gateway to do this for you automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, the Database Gateway is a very handy tool that can be used in a variety of situations. If you are looking for a way to connect to a database that is not currently supported by your development environment, or if you want to migrate your data from one format to another, then the Database Gateway is the tool for you.</p>

<h1 id="How-do-you-configure-the-Database-Gateway"><a href="#How-do-you-configure-the-Database-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="How do you configure the Database Gateway?"></a>How do you configure the Database Gateway?</h1><p>The Database Gateway configuration process is relatively easy.

<p>Once you have created your new connection, you can then drag and drop tables or views from the Server Explorer window into your application.</p>
