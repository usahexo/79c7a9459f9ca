For example, if you have an existing MySQL database and want to migrate it to Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the Database Gateway to do this for you automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, the Database Gateway is a very handy tool that can be used in a variety of situations. If you are looking for a way to connect to a database that is not currently supported by your development environment, or if you want to migrate your data from one format to another, then the Database Gateway is the tool for you.</p>
