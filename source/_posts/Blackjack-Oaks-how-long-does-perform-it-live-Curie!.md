The game is quite simple. All you need to do is place your bets, sit back and enjoy the game. The dealer will deal two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. One of the dealer's cards is face up and one is face down. The face up card is called the 'upcard'.

If you are dealt two identical cards, such as two eights, you can choose to double your bet by placing an additional bet next to your original bet. You will then be dealt one more card, which will become your third card. If this card is also an eight, you win automatically - irrespective of what the dealer's cards are.

If the first three cards dealt to a player total less than eleven, the player must hit - take another card. If the total equals eleven or more, the player stands - doesn't take any more cards. In Blackjack Oaks variation of blackjack, if the first three cards dealt add up to twelve or more, then it's automatic standing on 12 no matter what the dealers upcard is as long as hes not busting.. So if Dealer has Ace 2 3 players with 12 or more would still stand..

The aim of Blackjack Oaks is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting nearer 21 than the dealer without going over, or by stealing the pot when the dealer goes over 21 ('busting'). If you get nearer 21 than the dealer without going over (called 'winning'), you automatically win even money on your original bet plus your second bet (if placed). If you go bust, then you lose both bets.
