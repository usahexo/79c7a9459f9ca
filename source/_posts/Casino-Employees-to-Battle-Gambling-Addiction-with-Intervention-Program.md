#  Casino Employees to Battle Gambling Addiction with Intervention Program

Employees of casino resorts around the world will soon be receiving training on how to deal with problem gambling in their colleagues.

The move comes as a response to growing concern about the number of people working in the casino industry who are struggling with gambling addiction.

According to a study conducted by the University of British Columbia, nearly one-third of all casino employees are addicted to gambling.

Thatâ€™s more than three times the rate of addiction among the general population.

The new intervention program will be launched in May and will include training for managers on how to identify and deal with problem gambling among their staff members.

It will also include counselling and support services for employees who are struggling with addiction.

The program is being funded by the Responsible Gambling Council, a non-profit group that works to promote responsible gambling practices.

#  Casino Uses Gaming Limits to Help Battle Gambling Addiction

Casinos are always looking for ways to keep their patrons safe and healthy. In addition to enforcing strict dress codes and banning intoxicated people from entering, casinos also use gaming limits to help battle gambling addiction.

Setting a spending limit on games is one way casinos can help prevent people from losing too much money. This limit can be placed on a single game or across all games at the casino. For example, someone might be limited to only spending $50 on blackjack in a day.

Another method casinos use to prevent addiction is by tracking how much money a person spends while playing. If a person is starting to spend too much money, the casino can step in and suggest they take a break from playing. This prevents people from continuing to gamble until they've lost everything they have.

Ultimately, using gaming limits is just one tool casinos have to help keep their customers safe and healthy. But it's an important one that helps protect against the dangers of gambling addiction.

#  Casino Offering Free Treatment for Those With Gambling Addiction

The Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City is now offering free treatment to those with a gambling addiction. This comes as the casino tries to rebuild its image after Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year. The casino has already spent $70 million on a renovation project that is set to be completed next year. Part of that renovation includes a new 75,000-square-foot facility for those with a gambling addiction.

The casino's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Allen, said in a statement that the goal is to provide "world-class care and world- class facilities" for those suffering from a gambling addiction. He also said that the casino is committed to doing whatever it takes to help those affected by this disease.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and even homelessness. Treatment for gambling addiction can be expensive and often hard to find. That is why the offer from the Hard Rock Casino is so welcome news for those affected by this disease.

It remains to be seen whether or not other casinos will follow suit and offer free treatment for those with a gambling addiction. But the fact that the Hard Rock Casino is doing so shows that there is growing awareness of this problem and that more needs to be done to address it.

#  Casino Removes Slot Machines in Effort to Curb Gambling Addiction

The Wynn casino in Las Vegas has announced that it will be removing all of its slot machines from the premises in an effort to curb gambling addiction. This is a bold move for the casino, which is the largest in Las Vegas, and could set a new standard for how casinos deal with gambling addiction.

The decision to remove the slot machines was made after it was discovered that around two thirds of the casino's revenue came from slots. With so much money at stake, the casino decided that it needed to take action to prevent people from becoming addicted to gambling.

Removing the slot machines is not going to be easy for Wynn, but it is a necessary step if it wants to protect its customers. The casino has said that it will replace the slot machines with table games and other forms of entertainment.

This announcement comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as casinos have traditionally been reluctant to remove their slot machines. However, Wynn appears to be taking a proactive approach to gambling addiction and is hoping that other casinos will follow its lead.

#  Gambling Addicts Find Strength in Support Group at Casino

In a small room at the back of the casino, a dozen people are seated around a large table. Some are sipping coffee, others are smoking cigarettes. All of them are anxious.

This is the Gamblers Anonymous support group, and for these people, attending is a last resort. They've all tried to quit gambling on their own, but they can't seem to break the habit. They're hoping that by sharing their stories and swapping tips, they can finally overcome their addiction.

"Hi, my name is Joe and I'm a gambling addict," Joe says as he begins to speak. "I've been hooked on gambling for as long as I can remember. I've lost count of how much money I've wasted on casino games, but it's probably in the tens of thousands of dollars."

Joe isn't alone in his struggle. Each person at the table has their own story of how gambling has ruined their life. But despite their individual struggles, they all share one common goal: to get clean and stay clean.

The group meets every Wednesday night at the casino and it's been helping them all to stay on track. They encourage each other when they feel tempted to gamble and offer support when things get tough.

"I know it isn't easy, but together we can do this," one member tells the group. "We're not alone in this fight."

The group has been meeting for over a year now and most of its members have managed to stay away from casinos altogether. There have been a few slips-ups along the way, but they continue to support each other through thick and thin.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, consider seeking help from a support group like Gamblers Anonymous. It may be just what you need to finally overcome your addiction and get your life back on track
