#  How to Make a Portable Minecart Machine in Minecraft 

With the release of Minecraft 1.13, the game has added a new feature that allows players to create a machine that can move minecarts around. This article will show you how to make a portable minecart machine in Minecraft.

The first thing you need to do is build a frame for your machine. The frame should be a square or rectangle with 4 blocks high and at least 4 blocks wide. The frame should also have a block on each of its corners so the minecarts can move around.

Next, you need to add some rails to the frame. The rails should be placed in the middle of the frame so the minecarts can move back and forth.

Now, you need to add some powered rails to the frame. The powered rails will power the minecarts and allow them to move around.

Finally, you need to add some minecarts to the frame. The minecarts will ride on the rails and move around the frame.

There are many reasons why you might want to create a minecart station in Minecraft. Perhaps you need to move your resources around quickly and easily, or you want to set up a transportation system for your players. Whatever the reason, creating a minecart station is a quick and easy process.

To start, you’ll need some supplies. For this project, you’ll need:

-24 cobblestones
-1 sign
-1 block of obsidian
-1 saddle
-1 minecart

Once you have all of your supplies, it’s time to start building! Begin by creating a 3x3 square using the cobblestones. In the center of the square, place an obsidian block. This will serve as the base for your station. Next, stand in the center of the obsidian block and place a saddle on your horse. Now jump on top of the saddle and press “e” to summon your minecart. Finally, use the /sethome command to set your home point at the minecart station. Now whenever you want to return home, simply summon your minecart and hop on!
