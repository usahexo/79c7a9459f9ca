#  How to Remove Bingo Ink from Clothing - Reader's Digest

Removing bingo ink can be a challenge, but it is not impossible. There are a few different ways that you can try to remove the ink, and the best way to remove it will depend on the type of fabric that the clothing is made from.

If the clothing is made from a synthetic fabric, such as nylon or polyester, you can try using rubbing alcohol. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a cloth and dab at the ink until it starts to fade. Be careful not to scrub too hard, or you could damage the fabric.

If the clothing is made from a natural fabric, such as cotton or wool, you can try using lemon juice or white vinegar. Pour some lemon juice or white vinegar onto a cloth and dab at the ink until it starts to fade. Again, be careful not to scrub too hard, or you could damage the fabric.

The ink from bingo daubers can be a challenge to remove from clothing. While there are several commercial products available to remove the ink, there are also some household remedies that work well.

*Before Beginning Any Cleaning Process*

Check the fabric care label to see if the clothing can be safely cleaned with bleach. If it can, then a bleach solution may be the best option for removing the ink. Be sure to test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area of the fabric before using it on the entire garment.

If the clothing cannot be safely cleaned with bleach, then try one of these methods:

*Using Ammonia*

Mix one part ammonia with four parts water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution directly on the ink stain and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, blot the stain with a clean cloth until it is removed. Repeat if necessary.

Be careful not to get any ammonia on your skin, as it can cause irritation. Also, avoid using this method if you have any wool clothing, as ammonia can damage wool fibers.

 ink on clothing can be a real pain to remove, especially if it's bingo ink. This type of ink is typically used in schools and other places where children are likely to get messy. Thankfully, there are a few ways to remove it without damaging the fabric.

The first step is to identify the type of ink that's been spilled. If it's water-based ink, you can treat it with a laundry detergent. For oil-based inks, you'll need an alcohol-based solvent like isopropyl alcohol or ethanol.

If the ink has already dried, you can try scraping it off with a dull object like a spoon or butter knife. Be careful not to damage the fabric while doing this.

Once the ink is removed, you can either wash the garment as usual or use a Stain Stick to help prevent future staining.
