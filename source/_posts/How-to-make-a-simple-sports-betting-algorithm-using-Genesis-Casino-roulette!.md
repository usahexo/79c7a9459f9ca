#  How to make a simple sports betting algorithm using Genesis Casino roulette!

## Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to make a basic sports betting algorithm using Genesis Casino roulette. You will first need to create an account and deposit some funds. Once you have done this, you can start betting on your favourite sports events!

In order to make a profit from sports betting, you will need to employ a basic betting algorithm. In simple terms, this algorithm involves calculating the probability of each possible outcome, then betting on the outcome with the highest probability. This tutorial will show you how to do this using Genesis Casino roulette.

Let's get started!

## Introduction

Making a financial bet on the outcome of a sports event is nothing new. People have been doing it for centuries, and with the advent of Bitcoin, it has become easier than ever to place a wager. However, most people still use crude methods to make their bets, like simply picking the team they think will win or choosing a random number. In this article, we will show you how to create a simple sports betting algorithm that will make your bets much more profitable.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm we are going to use is called Kelly Criterion. It is a mathematical formula that tells you how much of your bankroll you should bet on each game in order to maximise your profits. The basic idea behind the algorithm is that you should always bet enough to make a profit, but never so much that you risk losing your entire bankroll.

There are a few different ways to calculate the Kelly Criterion, but we will be using the simplest version here. The equation looks like this:

\begin{equation} K = \frac{\log(B)}{\lambda} \end{equation}

Where:
- $K$ is the Kelly Criterion percentage
- $B$ is your bankroll
- $\lambda$ is the odds of winning for your chosen bet (e.g. 1/2 for betting on Team A to win)

 Plugging in our values, we get:

\begin{equation} K = \frac{\log(100)}{1/2} = 20% \end{equation}

This means that we should be betting 20% of our bankroll on each game. Note that this percentage may vary depending on the odds and your bankroll size. You can play around with the equation to find the right percentage for you.

Now that we know how to calculate our Kelly Criterion percentage, let's take a look at how to put it into practice. First, we need to find an online sports betting site that accepts Bitcoin deposits. There are plenty of these sites online, but we recommend Betcoin Sports . They have excellent customer service and offer generous bonuses for new players. Once you have registered for an account, it's time to start betting! Simply choose the sport and event you want to bet on, and then enter the amount you want to wager in the "Bet" field. Be sure to select "Kelly" from the "Method" menu so that your bet will be calculated using the Kelly Criterion algorithm. Click "Place Bet" and you're good to go!

In this article, we're going to learn how to make a simple sports betting algorithm with MatLab. We'll first import the necessary libraries and then get started on the code.

% matlab

clear all;

close all;


importing Libraries:

% Betting library 
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismanning/betting-scripts/master/betting.m";
load(url);

% Plotting library  
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismanning/betting-scripts/master/plotting.m";
load(url);

% Generic math library  
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismanning/betting-scripts/master/math.m";
load(url);

We'll now begin writing the code for our betting algorithm:
% Initialize variables  
vARIABLE_WITH_TEAM1 = 0; % Set to 0 before each game begins 
vARIABLE_WITH_TEAM2 = 0; % Set to 0 before each game begins 
sUCURRENTGAME = 1; % Used to keep track of the current game 
gAMETIME = 0; % The time of the game in seconds since January 1st, 1970  
fCONDITIONAL = 3; % The conditional probability of Team 1 winning (3%)

function main() % Our main function {

	team1wins=0;		team2wins=0;

	currentgame=1;		gametime=0;

	fprobability1=3; //Our conditional probability of Team 1 winning (3%)

	while currentgame<length(games) % While there are still games to be played... {

	get(games{currentgame},'Time'); % Get the time of the game from the dataframe 		if gametime>gAMETIME % If the time has passed since our last game... {

	gAMETIME=gametime+3600*24*60*60; % Update our global variable for the next game 		sUCURRENTGAME++; % Increment our counter for the current game 	}

• elseif gametime<gAMETIME && team1wins==0 && team2wins==0) % If it is still halftime... {

  reset(games{currentgame});% Reset our variables for the next game   team1wins=1;% Assign Team 1 as the winner so far   team2wins=0;% Assign Team 2 as the loser so far  } else % Otherwise, if it is not halftime... {

  team1wins=team2wins=0;% Reset totals for both teams  }

	end » vARIABLE_WITH_TEAM1 » ans» vARIABLE_WITH_TEAM2

## 1. Introduction 

Greetings Betters, in this article we are going to cover the basics of how to make a simple sports betting algorithm. This will be perfect for those who have no prior experience with betting algorithms and coding in general. We will be using the programming language Python for our examples. If you don't have any experience with Python, don't worry! The code we write in this article is easy to follow and doesn't require much prior knowledge.

Now, let's get started!

#  How to make a simple sports betting algorithm in 5 easy steps!

1. Choose the sport you want to bet on

The beauty of betting is that you can choose to bet on any sport you like! From horse racing to American football, there’s a sport out there for everyone. So, before you can even begin to make an algorithm, you first need to decide which sport you want to focus on.

2. Research past results

To create a successful betting algorithm, it’s important that you do your research and understand the trends associated with your chosen sport. Look at past match results and try to identify any patterns or winning strategies that may exist.

3. Use this information to create your betting strategy

Once you have a good understanding of past results, it’s time to put this information into practice and create your very own betting strategy! Decide how much money you want to risk on each bet and then choose your bets accordingly. Remember, it’s always best to stick to bets that offer good value, so don’t be tempted to gamble blindly.

4. Calculate probabilities

In order to make accurate predictions, it’s important that you calculate the probabilities of each potential outcome. This can be done quite easily by using a simple mathematical formula. Don’t worry if maths isn’t your strongest subject – there are plenty of online calculators that can do all the hard work for you!

5. Place your bets!

Now that you have everything in place, it’s time to start placing your bets! Remember to stay disciplined and only bet what you can afford to lose. With a bit of luck, you could soon find yourself making some healthy profits from sports betting!
