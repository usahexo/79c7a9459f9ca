#  Could Leicester City Win the Title Again?

This season, Leicester City are one of the teams tipped to do well in the Premier League. They surprised many with their title win in 2016, and there is a feeling they could do it again.

Manager Craig Shakespeare has been in charge since February, after Claudio Ranieri was sacked, and he has helped to turn things around. The team have only lost one game under his leadership and this has seen them move up the table.

Leicester currently sit in 8th place in the Premier League, just six points behind Arsenal in 4th place. This means that a top four finish is still possible and would be an incredible achievement for the team.

The squad has been strengthened this season with the addition of players such as Kelechi Iheanacho from Manchester City. He has already scored three goals for the club and will be looking to help them push on towards the end of the season.

There is no doubt that Leicester City have some talented players and they will be hoping to finish the season as strongly as possible. Can they win the title again? Only time will tell…

#  Ohio Residents Place Their Bets on Leicester City



Leicester City's improbable championship run in the English Premier League has captivated fans around the world, but nowhere more so than in Ohio, where several groups of fans have pooled their money to place bets on the club.

Since relegation from the top flight in 2004, Leicester City had sunk to the depths of English football, spending two seasons in the third tier and narrowly avoiding relegation from the second division. But with new ownership and a new manager, Leicester won seven of their final nine games to earn promotion back to the Premier League.

In their first season back in the top flight, Leicester were widely expected to be relegated again, but they instead mounted an unlikely title challenge, crashing out of the race only on the final day of the season. This year they have been even better, topping the table for much of the season before falling just short in the end.

In Ohio, several groups of fans have placed bets totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars on Leicester to win the Premier League. One group even flew to England to see them play live this season.

"I've been a Leicester fan since I was a kid," said Tim Hoyle, one of the Ohioans who put money on Leicester. "I never thought I'd see them win anything, let alone the Premier League, but it's been an incredible ride."

#  Will Leicester City's Recent Success Garner them More Fans in Ohio?

Leicester City, a small city in the East Midlands of England, is home to one of the most unlikely champions in Premier League history. 5,000-to-1 odds of winning the title at the beginning of last season Leicester City emerged victorious and completed what will go down as one of the most improbable sporting feats in history.

As a Foxes fan myself, I was eagerly anticipating my team’s return to preseason this year and curious to see how they would fare with some new high-profile signings. I was not alone in wondering this; Leicester City’s championship win had generated a lot of worldwide attention, and many people were eager to see if they could replicate their success.

 preseason fixtures are now underway and Foxes fans around the world are gearing up for another Premier League campaign. One interesting market that has yet to be tapped into by Leicester City is that of Ohioans. A recent study by Ticket IQ showed that only 10% of Ohioans claimed to be fans of Leicester City – a surprisingly low number given the club’s recent accomplishments.

This offers a great opportunity for Leicester City to capitalize on their championship win and grow their fanbase in one of America’s most important states. There are currently no plans for any sort of tour or visit to Ohio by the club, but as their popularity grows it is likely that they will make an appearance there at some point in the future.

In order for Leicester City to capitalize on their title win, they will need to continue achieving success both domestically and in European competition. A difficult task, but not an impossible one – after all, no one expected them to win the Premier League title last season in the first place. So far this preseason they have looked strong, with new signing Islam Slimani scoring a brace on his debut against Barcelona.

Leicester City have already proven that they are a force to be reckoned with and I am excited to see how they perform this season. If you are an Ohioan looking for a new football team to support, I would highly recommend giving Leicester City a try – you might just end up becoming a fan like me!

#  Leicester City Looks to replicate their UK Success Overseas with Ohioans

Leicester City, a small team in the UK that nobody ever thought would be successful, shocked the world this year by winning the Premiere League Championship. This underdog story has inspired people all around the world, and many people are wondering if Leicester City can replicate their success overseas.

Now, a group of passionate Ohioans have decided to start their own Leicester City fan club in order to try and bring some of that championship magic to Columbus. The fan club is called LCFC Ohio and they are hoping to create some excitement around the team as they head into their first season in the MLS.

“The Foxes captured our hearts this year with their incredible Cinderella story, and we want to bring that same excitement to Columbus,” said LCFC Ohio president John Hagan. “Our goal is to build a strong community of Leicester City fans here in Ohio, and we hope to see them thrive on the pitch just as they have done in the UK.”

Leicester City has already gained a following overseas, with over 160 official fan clubs around the world. And now with LCFC Ohio being established in Columbus, it looks like that number is only going to continue to grow.
