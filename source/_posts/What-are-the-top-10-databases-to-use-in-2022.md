#  How were they selected?

The Apollo astronauts were not only some of the most highly skilled pilots and scientists in the world, but they were also carefully selected for their qualities that would make them good representatives of America. They needed to be physically and mentally fit, have good communication skills, and be able to work well in a team.

To be eligible for the program, an astronaut had to be from the United States military, have a college degree in engineering or science, and have at least three years of flying experience. The finalists went through a rigorous selection process that included spending time in a isolation tank, taking a grueling physical examination, and undergoing psychological testing.

Only seven men were ever chosen to become astronauts on the Apollo program. They were Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Michael Collins, David Scott, James Irwin, and Charles Duke.
